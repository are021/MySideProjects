# JavaScript

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can handle both frontend and backend design on a website. On my profile, you may have seen some simple websites I have created using JS. <br>

This folder will contain some aditional JavaScript projects, where I will use frameworks like React and Angular to build websites and applications. Since I am still learning web development, these folders may be empty for a while, but fret not! My journey will eventually lead me back to this repository!
