# Simple Stack Quiz Game

While learning stacks in my Data Structures Class, I got the idea to make a simple quiz game using stacks. 
The premise is, get all questions right in a row until the time runs up. If you get a question wrong, another 'question' is pushed onto the stack.
These questions are simple addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division problems, but I wanted to add different modes as well eventually.

## To Play This Game

Run this game in the Terminal by downloading the two stacks.py files. Then in terminal type <br>
%python3 stacksFun.py

Enjoy!
